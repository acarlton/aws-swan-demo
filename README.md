# AWS ECS Demo

A demo application featuring deployment and CI/CD for a Hello World application on AWS ECS Fargate. Infrastructure is defined in Terraform code and deployed automatically.

## Environments

* Production: https://aws-ecs-demo.carlucci.network
* Development: https://dev.aws-ecs-demo.carlucci.network

Route53 hosted zones are provisioned for each environment and DNS name servers are delegated to from the parent domain.

## Features

* Repository build process and CI/CD with Github Actions using an OIDC integration with AWS
* Basic VPC networking consisting of:
    * 2 public subnets
    * 2 private subnets
    * Internet gateway
    * NAT gateway
    * External traffic routing tables
* An ECS cluster, service and task running a basic Hello World web application
* Simple autoscaling configuration for ECS service based on CPU and memory target utilization
* An application load balancer receiving public traffic and forwarding to ECS in private subnets
* Definition of a KMS customer managed key for encryption, with support for cross-region replication to enable future multi-region deployments
* CloudWatch logging with KMS CMK encryption
* DNS name resolution
* Custom Hello World Nginx container image hosted in ECR with CI/CD deployment workflow
* SSL traffic encryption:
    * Public HTTPS traffic
    * Encryption everywhere for private VPC traffic
        * Self-signed certificate generation
        * SSM Parameter Store secrets for key and certificate encrypted using KMS CMK
        * Certificate installation and configuration on ECS task bootstrap

## Contributing

This is a demo project, and doesn't expect to attract contributors, but for the sake of exposition, here is a section on development practices.

We use the [git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) where features are implemented in `feature/*` branches and staged into `develop`. Releases are tagged and merged into `main`, which tracks the current stable state of production code.

Generally, pull requests that contain a more-or-less complete feature implementation are squash-merged into `develop`.

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) keeps a record of the features in each release and new work should be documented in the "Unreleased" section until the next release.

Whenever we get around to customizing the Docker image into a more complicated application, we will be using the [3musketeers](https://github.com/flemay/3musketeers) pattern to standardize an interface for common development tasks and processes.

## Alternatives

### AWS Copilot

It is worth noting that the majority of this infrastructure could be quickly and easily configured and deployed using [AWS Copilot](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli).

### Contributed Terraform modules

There is a large online library of contributed Terraform modules that could be leveraged to speed the development process. However, we generally prefer to write the Terraform code custom. One never knows how restricted access is to the underlying infrastructure resources until later in the application lifecycle. Decoupling from contributed infrastructure dependencies can be tricky and time consuming.
