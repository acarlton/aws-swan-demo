    # Originally the workflow implementation was setup to use environment
    #  variables configured in the Github repository settings. However,
    #  after moving to a reusable action, it became ugly to pass those values
    #  into the called action due to this bug:
    #
    #    https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/26671#discussioncomment-4295807
    #
    #  So now we're hardcoding the values here and using it as a manifest. Please see
    #  commit 1ec7a0346abc04b73c03e35c0e228e9dba14300c for the previous implementation.
